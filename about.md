Hello! My name is Paul Lim and I am a graduate of UC Berkeley class of 2016. I received my B.S. in Chemical Engineering with a minor in Industrial Engineering Operations Research (IEOR).  I have experience as an engineer, researcher, and environmental consultant.  

Currently, I am gaining experience as a data scientist at Metis by honing my skills in Python, machine learning, and statistics.  

Feel free to contact me!  I'm currently in the San Francisco area and am always available for a coffee chat!
